I am a Ph.D. scholar at the esteemed Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar, specializing in the field of Array Signal Processing working under the guidance of Prof. Nithin V. George. My research focuses on developing innovative techniques and adaptive algorithms to enhance the performance of array antennas for DOA estimation, and beamforming which I try to incorporate my expertise in signal processing principles and theoretical analysis.


Research Interest: Array Signal Processing, Adaptive filtering, DOA estimation, beamforming, Machine Learning, Statistical Signal Processing
